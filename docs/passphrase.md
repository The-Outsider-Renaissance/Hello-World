**Passphrase Policy**

(NIST-CSF-PR.AC-2) (NIST-CSF-PR.IP-8)

Employees at Power Home Remodeling must be able to access a variety of technical resources, including computers, data storage systems, and other software and hardware devices. Passwords are a key part of BT’s strategy to make sure only authorized people are able to access those resources and data.

All employees who have access to any of those resources are responsible for choosing strong passphrases and protecting their log-in information from unauthorized people. The purpose of this policy is to make sure all Power Home Remodeling resources and data receive adequate passphrase protection.

When available, Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) must be used, especially for high value accounts. MFA is a method of requiring an additional verification beyond the passphrase; usually in the form of a text message or a physical key. This prevents unauthorized access if your passphrase is compromised. "Something you have and something you know"

**Passphrase creation**

(NIST-CSF-PR.AC-4) (NIST-CSF-PR.IP-7)

* All passphrases should be reasonably complex and difficult to guess. Employees should choose passphrases that are at least twelve characters long, containing a combination of upper- and lower-case letters, numbers, and punctuation marks and other special characters is encouraged. These requirements will be enforced with software when possible.
* In addition to meeting those requirements, employees should also use common sense when choosing passwords. They should avoid basic combinations that are easy to crack or guess. For instance; choices like “password”, “password1”, “Pa$$w0rd” and "f!q839sQ" are all equally bad from a security perspective.
* A passphrase should be unique, with meaning only to the employee who chooses it. That means dictionary words, common phrases and even names should be avoided. Here are some recommended methods to choosing a strong passphrase that is still easy to remember:
 * Pick a phrase, and use it! “Sometimes.I.like.to.eat.grapes!” (31 characters, upper & lower case, special characters)
 * If complex requirements are needed: “Sometimes.I.like.to.eat.gr@p35!” (31 characters, upper & lower case, numbers, special characters)
* Employees must choose unique passphrases for all of their company accounts, and may not use a passphrase that they are already using for a personal account or their Nitro passphrase.
* All passphrases must be changed every six months with the frequency varying based on the sensitivity of the account in question. This requirement will be enforced using software when possible.
* If the security of a passphrase is in doubt– for example, if it appears that an unauthorized person has logged in to the account — the passphrase must be changed immediately. BT is also to be notified immediately by opening a ticket.
* Default passphrases — such as those created for new employees when they start or those that protect new systems when they’re initially set up — must be changed as quickly as possible.

**Protecting passphrases**

(NIST-CSF-PR.AC-1) (NIST-CSF-PR.DS-5)

* Employees must _never share_ their passphrase with anyone else in the company, including co-workers, managers, administrative assistants, BT staff members, etc. Everyone who needs access to a system will be given their own unique passphrase. If you think you need access to something, ask your manager to open a ticket with BT.
* Employees must never share their passphrases with any outside parties, including those claiming to be representatives of a business partner with a legitimate need to access a system.
* Employees may never share their passphrases with family members.
* Employees should take steps to avoid phishing scams and other attempts to steal passphrases and other sensitive information. All employees will receive training on how to recognize these attacks.
* Employees must not write passphrases down or keep them written at their workstations. See above for advice on creating memorable but secure passphrases.
* Employees may not use a password manager or other tools to help store and remember passwords without BT’s permission. Currently 1Password and BitWarden are acceptable password managers.

**Passphrase Training**

(NIST-CSF-PR.AT-1) (NIST-CSF-PR.AT-2)

It is crucial for the BT team to play a powerful role in educating the rest of the company including in-house and remote workers about the importance of a strong passphrase and the kinds of risks and threats they might invite in the absence of one.
Employees will be trained on proper passphrase creation and storage as a part of on-boarding. Yearly passphrase training will occur for all employees. Members of BT will receive training twice a year. The purpose of this is not only to remind the team of the importance of passphrases, understand their role and responsibility to the business, but also to open the dialog on how users are adhering to the policy.
A key part of training is to describe all the common as well as rare security risk scenarios and the reasons behind the attacks and explain the types of loss that the company and employees would confront in case any of these cybersecurity attacks take place.

**Delivering Passphrases to users after a passphrase reset**

In the event you have to perform a passphrase reset for a user and need to send them their new passphrase OR share a passphrase with a vendor:

* DO NOT send passphrases through Connect or E-mail
* Inform the user they MUST change the passphrase once they are logged back into the system
* Use https://onetimesecret.com/ to send the PASSPHRASE ONLY
* If you are unfamiliar with One Time Secret, please take the time to familiarize yourself with it before interacting with users.
